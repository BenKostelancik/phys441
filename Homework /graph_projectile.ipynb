    "# Projectile Motion with Air Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Projectile motion in two dimensions is governed by a fairly simple set of coupled differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceleration components are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_x(t) = \\frac{F_x(t)}{m} = \\frac{d v_x(t)}{dt}$$\n",
    "$$ a_y(t) = \\frac{F_y(t)}{m} = \\frac{d v_y(t)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity components are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_x(t) = \\frac{d x(t)}{dt}$$\n",
    "$$ v_y(t) = \\frac{d y(t)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, with no air resistance, we saw that for these differential equations, the midpoint method gave the most accurate numerical answers, for a given timestep.  We will use the midpoint method again here, but we will need to modify the acceleration components to include the effects of air resistance.  The force of air resistance is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{air} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\\rho$ is the density of air, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the projectile, and $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity of the projectile.  The direction of the force is opposite the direction of the velocity.  The acceleration components are then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_x(t) = \\frac{F_x(t)}{m} = \\frac{d v_x(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A \\frac{v_x(t)}{m} v(t)$$\n",
    "$$ a_y(t) = \\frac{F_y(t)}{m} = \\frac{d v_y(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A \\frac{v_y(t)}{m} v(t) - g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.  We can simplify these equations by defining a constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = -\\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A \\frac{1}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then the acceleration components become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_x(t) = \\frac{d v_x(t)}{dt} = k v(t) v_x(t)$$\n",
    "$$ a_y(t) = \\frac{d v_y(t)}{dt} = k v(t) v_y(t) - g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the midpoint method to solve these differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we will always need to know a set of initial conditions:  the initial velocity in the x- and y-directions, and the initial position in the x- and y-directions:  $v_x(0) = v_{x0}, v_y(0) = v_{y0}, x(0) = x_0, y(0) = y_0$"
